The code is written in Matlab R2016a. 
The code includes five parts. The first one is data processing. The second one is for calucating the network entropy to delete the 
excess edges. The third one is simulation for the network. The forth one is for calucating important nodes in the network by sorting
the network entropy. And the last one is the data set.
